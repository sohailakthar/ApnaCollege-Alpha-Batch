    4 keywords in OOPS:-
    1. Encapsulation:
        Binding data and methods together. Achieved with classes

    2. Inheritance:
        Inheriting data fields and methods from a super class.
        Types:
            i. Single-level/Simple      A -> B
            ii. Multi-level             A -> B -> C
            iii. Hierarchical           A -> B  &  A -> C ....
            iv. Hybrid                  Combination of more than one inheritance type
            v. Multiple                 A -> C  &  B -> C   (C inheriting from both A and B)... Can only be implemented using interfaces

    3. Polymorphism:
        Poly means 'Many' and Morph means 'Forms'.  Basically, we can use one thing in multiple forms
        Types:
            i. Compile time polymorphism: Having same method name with varying type/number/sequence of arguments/parameters.
            ii. Run time polymorphism: Having same method, parameters, return type but possibly different implementation. Achieved by Abstract class and Interfaces

    4. Abstraction:
        Hiding unnecessary stuff.
        This is achieved by using Abstract class and Interfaces.



    Abstract class:-
        - Cannot create an instance of abstract class
        - Can have abstract/non-abstract methods
        - Can have constructors
